# Climate Risks and Opportunities for Permanent Agriculture
Extensive information exists regarding the effects of climate change on agriculture. However, there is often a gap between the individuals responsible for publishing this information and the individuals responsible for making decisions. This gap is particularly acute for permanent crops, such as apples. To bridge this gap, we have developed a proof of concept for apple growers and apple processors, providing insight into the cultivars that will and will not be resilient in face of climate change, focusing on the next twenty years for existing orchards in the Eastern Mountain region of the United States. If successful, a similar approach could be used in other regions, for other decisions, or for other permanent crops, democratizing the availability of climate data.
